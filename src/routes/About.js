        The COVID-19 outbreak is devastating bars and bakery. We thought we could help them to survive these days.<br/><br/>
        At the moment these small bars and bakeries could still sell their products until 6 pm.<br/><br/>
        Most bars and bakeries have thousands of euros in food and alcohol, which they can sell to people who are living next to them.Â <br/><br/>
        People can still enjoy their favourite bakery and wine from the bars in the corner.<br/><br/>
